# Now
- [x] timer that counts down for 5 seconds
- [ ] at expire show a notifcation via osascript
- [ ] read response to osascript dialog
- [ ] snooze that fucker
- [ ] pass duration via args

# Later
- figure out go modules and use?
- search for a more generic library
- maybe abstract notifications into separate package
